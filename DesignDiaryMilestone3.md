# Design Diary - Milestone 3

This Milestone proved to be very difficult for me. I spent well over 20 hours trying to debug the
countless issues I encountered. Due to personal time constraints, I was unable to dedicate the
necessary time required for this assignment until 3/15/2020. At that point, my classmates/group members
were on spring break and I was only able to figure out my issues via YouTube tutorials and other website
tutorials. I also was not able to get in contact with my group members during this assignment. I only
spoke with Summer briefly while walking to my next class and she said that she was planning on doing
the default Milestone objectives. Drew was in class on the last day before break, but I did not realize
it until after class had ended. I was unable to contact Drew at all during the entire duration of this 
Milestone.  I really feel like I did poorly on this assignment and I wish I was able to start on it sooner
and collaborate more with my group members. 

I wish I had more to say about this Milestone and the design changes/experiences I went through, but I had
such a rough time getting to what you see as the finished product due to my lack of familiarity with the
numerious libararies available and the Python language in general. I enjoyed working with Jupyter notebook
and I would like to use it later, but I did not enjoy trying to debug the error codes produced by the
various unfamiliar libraries.

My LICEcap program stopped working so I was forced to use another GIF program and that also failed. I am
unable to provide a GIF due to technical issues, sorry.
